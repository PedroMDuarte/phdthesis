\chapter{Many body physics with ultracold atoms } 

\section{ Motivation:  Strongly correlated materials }

Our experiences in the physical world can, for the most part, be explained by
considering the description of collections of positively charged nuclei and
negatively charged electrons that make up ordinary matter.    From high to low
energy this includes: neutral plasmas,  free atoms and molecules, atoms and
molecules that have condensed into liquid or glassy phases or crystalized to
form solids.   At lower energies more exotic phenomena take place, starting
with magnetism and going further to superfluidity, superconductivity and the
novel examples of modern condensed matter physics such as the fractional
quantum Hall effect, heavy electrons, high-temperature superconductors and
topological insulators.

In principle,  the correct description of all the above phenomena is contained
in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the interacting system of electrons and
nuclei,  where the interaction is given by the Coulomb potential. In practice,
we know that even though stating the equation is easy, there is not sufficient
computing power available in the world to solve it for systems of more than
just a few particles.  Xiao-Gang Wen, in the introduction to his
book~\cite{wen2004quantum}, points out that back in the 80's a computer with 32
MB of RAM could solve a sytem of 11 interacting electrons.  In the 2000's,
while computing power has increased more than 100 times, this allows for the
addition of only two more electrons to the system.  

Despite the above,  the use of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and perturbation
theory for the description of  systems of electrons and nuclei has been very
succesful over the past century.  The most prominent example of this success is
our understanding of semiconductors, which are at the root of the electronic
devices that permeate all aspects of our lives.  The remarkable success of this
approach can be traced back to the principle of adiabatic
continuity~\cite{altland2010condensed}. This principle  states that  the
low-energy excitations of an interacting system  are  \textbf{non-interacting
quasi-particles} which can be closely related to the actual particles that form
the interacting system.   This last sentence may sound confusing, but think
about a hole in the valence band of a semiconductor.  We don't typically think
of the properties of the hole as collective properties of the system of
electrons because it is a low energy excitation, i.e. a
\textbf{quasi-particle}, and it's properties are remarkably similar to those of
a free electron albeit with a postive rather than a negative charge.  The fact
that an electron and a hole behave so similarly is not at all intuitive,
especially if one considers the Coulomb interaction. However, adiabatic
continuity guarantees that for pratical purposes we can think of the hole
simply as a postively charged electron.  

The practical consequence of adiabatic continuity is that interactions
seemingly do not play an important role in the low-energy description of the
system.  For this reason, the free electron model of Drude and
Sommerfeld~\cite{ashcroft1976solid} is relatively succesful in explaining
electrical and thermal conductivity in metals,  and also in explaining the Hall
effect.   In 1957, Landau formulated the theory of the
Fermi-Liquid~\cite{landau1965collected} and gave a solid basis to the notion of
adiabatically connected quasiparticles.  To this day, the Fermi-Liquid theory
is the \textit{de facato} starting point for the study of Fermi systems such as
conventional metals, helium-3, and ultracold atomic Fermi gases.   

But, just as Fermi-Liquid theory is celebrated for its success it is also known
for the phenomena that it fails to explain.   Starting in the mid 70's and
going through the 80's, the discoveries of heavy electron
superconductivity~\cite{PhysRevLett.35.1779,PhysRevLett.43.1892},  the
fractional quantum Hall effect~\cite{PhysRevLett.48.1559,PhysRevLett.50.1395},
and high-temperature superconductors~\cite{Zeitschrift.64.189} sparked a
revolution in condensed matter physics~\cite{coleman2004revolution}.   These
materials, in which the electron behavior cannot be described effectively in
terms of non-interacting electron-like quasiparticles came to be known as
\textbf{strongly correlated materials}.   Strongly correlated materials, and
the concept of emergence, introduced by P.W.~Anderson in his famous essay
``More is Different''~\cite{Anderson1972}, are at the center of modern
condensed matter physics. 

The behavior of strongly correlated materials is emergent because the
low-energy excitations of the system bear no resemblance to its constituent
particles.  This disconnect should not be so surprising, after all we are
familiar with this definition of emergence whenever a system undergoes a phase
transition.  For example when a liquid cools down to form a crystalline solid,
continuous translational symmetry is broken.    The low-energy excitations of
the crystal are the quasiparticles known as phonons, which bear no resemblance
to the constituent ions and electrons that form the solid.  By going across the
liquid-to-solid phase-transition adiabatic continuity is violated; nevertheless,
it is easy to mathematically identify the low energy excitations of the system
and adscribe them the character of quasi-particles.  In the case of the
crystalline solid this is involves finding the normal modes of a set of coupled
oscillators.  

Strongly correlated materials are examples of emergent phenomena in which
the origin and properties of the low-energy excitations are not as
straightforward as those of phonons in a crystalline solid.  The fractional
quantum Hall state, in which the quasiparticles carry a rational fraction of
the electron charge serves to illustrate this point.  The strong
interactions between the electrons in the quantum Hall system (electrons
confined in a plane under a very high magnetic field) make the problem
intractable from the perturbative point of view and thus \textbf{the connection
between the microscopic degrees of freedom and the collective low-energy
excitations is very difficult to establish}; certainly not as easy as the
connection between small displacements of ions about their equillibrium points in
a crystal lattice and the collective phonon modes. It was Laughlin's
insight that led him to postulate the correct wavefunction  for the quantum
Hall state~\cite{PhysRevLett.50.1395}, but the microscopic origin of the state
is still under debate.   

The challenge posed by strongly correlated materials has led to great
discoveries in condensed matter physiccs, such as the concepts of topological
order~\cite{wen1990topological} and quantum
criticality~\cite{PhysRevB.14.1165,sachdev2011quantum}, but also many questions
remain unanswered.  Furthermore, the problem of strongly correlated materials
is only scratching the surface of what is possible and what remains to be
discovered.  New materials are being synthesized constantly.  Among the
myriad of possible materials and compunds yet to be explored by
materials scientists, one can only expect that there will be new states of
matter to be found; states with technological implications that will
revolutionize life on earth.  


\section{Quantum simulations with ultracold atoms}

We have seen that, even though the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in principle
contains a full description of a solid,  its solution is practically impossible
to compute using a classical computer due to the large memory required to
represent a many-body quantum state.   
%Beyond this issue of scalability there is also the issue of interpretation of
%the results:  suppose that we were able to access the exact quantum state of
%the system and its time dependence,  what would we even do with such
%information?   It would be practically impossible to come up with experiments
%that could test the full validity of the state, thus making such knowledge
%superfluous since, after all, physics is an empirical endeavor.
The approach in condensed matter theory, rather than directly aim to solve the
complete Schr\"{o}dinger equation, is to introduce simplified effective models,
which should capture the essential features of the system under study.  The
solution of the effective model leads to an understanding of the low-energy
excitations of the system and gives clues to their microscopic origin.   

The Hubbard model, formulated half a century ago~\cite{hubbard50} contains only
the essential ingredients necessary to describe the  behavior of strongly
interacting electrons moving in a periodic lattice. It describes electrons that
can hop between sites in a lattice (with probability amplitude $t$) , and which
acquire an interaction energy ($U$) when two electrons are on the same site,
see Figure~\ref{fig:chap01hubbard}.  
\begin{figure} \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{../figures/hubbard/little-hubbard.png}
\caption[Hubbard model]{\small Illustration of the Hubbard model }
\label{fig:chap01hubbard}
\end{figure}
The Hubbard model is an extension of the tight-binding model, with the
interactions between electrons incorporated as the on-site energy $U$.
After its inception, it was shortly realized~\cite{Hubbard1964} that the model
could explain the Mott metal-insulator transition, which was observed in the
transition metal oxides even though conventional band theory predicted them to
be conductors.  Beyond its early success, the Hubbard model is now the
quintessential model for strongly correlated systems.  It is widely accepted as
the most viable candidate to explain high-$T_{c}$ superconductors from first
principles.   Despite this fact, its exact solution in more than one dimension
has evaded theorists for more than four decades~\cite{quintanilla2009strong}.

It is at this point that ultracold atoms enter the picture.   It turns out that
ultracold atoms in an optical lattice provide a faithful realization of the
Hubbard model~\cite{PhysRevLett.81.3108}, thus the properties exhibited by the
collection of atoms are in fact the solutions of the model.    In this way,
such systems can be used to map the phase diagram of the Hubbard model in what
is known as \textbf{quantum simulation}, an idea that was first proposed by
Richard Feynman in 1982~\cite{feynman1982simulating}. 

In a seminal paper~\cite{PhysRevLett.81.3108}, Jaksch and collaborators  showed
that Bose-Einstein condensates of atoms loaded into optical lattices could be
used as simulators of the Bose-Hubbard model.  A few years later, the superfluid
(SF) to Mott insulator (MI) phase transition, the hallmark of the Bose-Hubbard
model, was realized experimentally~\cite{Greiner2002}, and several detailed
studies of this system have followed since then~\cite{Gemelke2009,
Jimenez-Garcia2010, Trotzky2010, Mark2011, Zhang2012}.  For bosonic systems the
properties of the ground state are well understood
theoretically~\cite{freericks1994bosehubbard, trivedi1991mott,
PhysRevB.40.546};  however, experiments of atoms in lattices are starting to
shed light into the dynamics of these systems~\cite{Fukuhara2013}, which are
more difficult to address for theorists.  

Despite the remarkable advances with bosonic systems, the ultimate goal of
quantum simulation with ultracold atoms is to find the ground states of
theoretically intractable fermionic models, to see if these models can
reproduce the measured properties of strongly correlated electron systems.  In
this prescription for quantum simulation, the subject of most interest is
whether or not the Hubbard model can exhibit a $d$-wave superfluid state which
would validate it as the prime model for high-$T_{c}$ superconductors.  In
pursuit of this goal, experiments have realized the Hubbard model with spin
mixtures of fermionic atoms, where two hyperfine levels of the atomic ground
state play the role of spin-up and spin-down states of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
electrons in real compounds. 

In these experiments, a quantum degenerate spin-mixture of fermionic atoms is
prepared in a harmonic potential and then transferred adiabatically into an
optical lattice potential.  The lattice depth and the contact interactions
between the atoms, which together set the values for the Hubbard parameters $t$
and $U$, can be controlled almost at will by the experimenter.  The tunneling
rate $t$ is controlled  by adjusting the intensity of the lattice lasers.
The interaction strength $U$ is controlled by setting the external magnetic
field and making use of a magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance, which offers
the possiblity of realizing non-interacting samples, or samples with
arbitrarily large  attractive or repulsive interactions\footnote{In practice it is observed that, for some values of the interaction strength, significant three-body losses and the associated heating rates prevent studying the equilibrium physics of the quantum gas.}.  These unprecedented
control over the system parameters has allowed the realization of band
insulating states~\cite{Kohl2005} and Mott insulating
states~\cite{Jordens2008,Schneider2008} with spin-mixtures of ultracold
fermionic atoms.  However, the possibility of exploring the strongly correlated
phases of the Hubbard model has not yet been realized because the required
temperatures are out of reach for current experiments.    


 
\section{Quantum magnetism with ultracold atoms }

Even though temperatures as low as $T\simeq 0.04\,T_{F}$ can be reached with
ultracold Fermi gases in a harmonic trap, these temperatures are not low enough
to allow exploration of the strongly correlated phases of the Hubbard model.
To get an idea of the temperature scales involved, we will examine a
qualitative temperature-doping 
%($T$-$x$) 
phase diagram, which can be obtained experimentally for the cuprate
high-$T_{c}$ superconductors\footnote{See \cite{Damascelli2003} for a review of
cuprate superconductors, \cite{He2011} for a study of the onset of
superconductivity at optimal hole-doping, \cite{Jin2011} for the phase diagram
of hole-doped cuprate superconductors and \cite{Grant2011} for a more
accessible report on the subject.}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:cartoon-phasediag}.
\begin{figure} \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{../figures/hubbard/highTc.png}
\caption[Cartoon phase diagram for cuprate high-$T_{\text{C}}$
superconductors.]{\small Cartoon phase diagram for cuprate high-$T_{\text{C}}$
superconductors. The anitiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) and the Fermi liquid
with quadratic resistivity are well understood by theory, however the strange
Fermi liquid with linear resistivity and the interplay between the pseudogap
regime and the superconducting dome are issues still under
debate~\cite{Grant2011}. }
\label{fig:cartoon-phasediag}
\end{figure}

The qualitative phase diagram shows that the cuprates exhibit various
interesting phases besides the superconducting (SC) dome at intermediate
doping.   Most importantly, the undoped parent compund is an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) Mott insulator with a N\'{e}el ordering temperature that is higher than
any value of the critical temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ along the SC dome.  

The onset of AFM ordering in the cuprate parent compounds is driven by the
magnetic exchange interaction~\cite{Koch2012}, where a pair of spins can lower
their energy if they can tunnel virtually to the neighboring site.  For a
single band model, the Pauli exclusion principle dictates that this is only
possible if neighboring sites have opposing spins, as in the N\'{e}el AFM
state.  The N\'{e}el temperature $T_{N}$ is then on the order of the exchange
energy $4t^{2}/U$, which is the second-order correction to the ground state
energy of a two-site model where the interaction $U$ is treated as a
perturbation.   The undoped parent compunds, at temperatures greater than and
up to several times $T_{N}$, will be Mott insulators with exactly one electron
per lattice site but without any kind of spin ordering. 

To put some estimates on the values of $T_{N}$ and $T_{c}$ let's consider the
most common high-$T_{c}$ superconductor~\cite{Milton2010},
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$, usually referred to as YBCO.  The critical
temperature for YBCO can be as large as $T_{c}\simeq 93$~K, obtained for
optimal hole-doping~\cite{Wu1987}. In the absence of doping, the YBCO parent
compound is antiferromagnetic with a N\'{e}el temperature $T_{N} \simeq 500
K$~\cite{Tranquada1988}.  The Fermi energy for YBCO is on the order of $\sim
4$~eV~\cite{liang2008ybco}, which corresponds to $\sim 40000$~K.  In units
ofthe Fermi temperature $T_{F}$, we have $T_{\text{C}}\simeq0.002\,T_{F}$,
and  $T_{\text{N}}\simeq0.012\,T_{F}$.

We immediately see that, in units of $T_{F}$,  the relevant temperatures for
$d$-wave superconductivity and for antiferromagnetism are both higher than
state of the art temperatures for ultracold fermionic atoms.  The Mott
insulator state (without spin ordering) was first realized with fermionic atoms
in a simple cubic lattice in 2008~\cite{Jordens2008,Schneider2008}.
Immediately after that the race started to see which group could be the first
to observe the AFM state and take the next step in the roadmap of quantum
simulation.   

Recently in 2013, the Esslinger group, at ETH Z\"{u}rich, has demonstrated a
way of using a dimerized optical lattice to measure the nearest neighbor spin
correlations that start to develop as a consequence of the exchange interaction
at temperatures a few times larger than the N\'{e}el temperature for AFM
ordering~\cite{Greif2013}.  They observe significant spin-spin correlations in
arrays of 1D chains and they can detect the spin-spin correlations that form on
the approach to AFM order in a simple cubic lattice.   Prior to the work of the
Esslinger group, the Bloch group used  a similar  optical super-lattice to
study exchange interactions with bosons in isolated
double-wells~\cite{Trotzky2008} and isolated four-site
plaquettes~\cite{Nascimbene2012}. 

Other experiments have realized AFM states by engineering Ising Hamiltonians
using trapped ions~\cite{Kim2010,Britton2012}, or by mapping motional degrees
of freedom to effective Ising models~\cite{Simon2011, Struck19082011}.  In
Ising type models, the magnetic coupling (anti or ferromagnetic) is put in by
hand in the Hamiltonian, and thus they realize what is referred to as classical
magnetism.  In the Hubbard model, on the other hand,  magnetism arises from the
exchange interaction, like it does in condensed matter systems such as the
transition metal oxides or the cuprate parent compounds.  Realizations of
classical magnetism are excellent systems to study magnetic frustration and the
dynamics of quenching the system accross a
phase-transition~\cite{PhysRevLett.111.053003}.   Systems of trapped ions can
help understand models with long range interactions~\cite{Richerme2014}, and
emerge as good candidates to realize universal quantum
computers~\cite{Britton2012}.  However, despite their advanteges in other
areas, these systems do not directly address the long-standing open question of
superconductivity in the Hubbard model.


Seven years ago the Hulet lab started an experiment to study strongly
correlated matter using ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our main goal
being to reach temperatures below the N\'{e}el transition temperature.  The
N\'{e}el state in the Hubbard model,  besides being the natural stepping stone
in the quest to simulating strongly correlated systems, offers the added
benefit that is a state that is well understood by theory~\cite{Paiva2011,
Fuchs2011}.   The ability to compare experimental results with theory offers a
testbed for quantum simulation and also a way to establish absolute thermometry
for ultracold atoms in optical lattices,  which is another major challenge in
this field~\cite{McKay2011}.  


%The absence of doping in the condensed matter system is
%equivalent to having a density of one atom per site in the ultracold atom
%system, also typically referred to as half-filling since the energy band has a
%total capacity of two atoms per site.  
%%The energy band has a total capacity of two atoms per site, so this $x=0$
%%point in the phase-diagram is also referred to as half-filling.   
%At half-filling, numerical approaches to the Hubbard model, such as
%determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)~\cite{Paiva2011},  and dynamical mean
%field theory (DMFT)~\cite{Fuchs2011} do not suffer from the Fermion sign
%problem~\cite{Jr1990}, and calculations can be performed down to temperatures
%below the N\'{e}el temperature for AFM ordering. 

\section{This thesis}

Over the course of this work we have used a compensated lattice potential,
which allows excellent control over the density distribution of the atoms in
the lattice.  The compensated lattice also mitigates heating of the atoms as
they are loaded into the lattice and has allowed us to reach temperatures as
low as 1.4~$T_{N}$, which is a factor of 2 colder than previous
experiments~\cite{Imriska2014}.  We measure the temperature of the atoms in the
lattice using Bragg scattering of light off of the magnetic sublattices that
start forming on the approach to the N\'{e}el transition.  This technique has
been discussed before~\cite{Ted2010} but only until now implemented.   A very
important aspect is the comparison to \textit{ab initio} numerical simulations
of the Hubbard model.   In our work we have used results from determinantal
quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)~\cite{Paiva2011} and from numerical linked-cluster
expansion (NLCE)~\cite{Rigol2006} calculations,  along with the local density
approximation to establish the link between light scattering and absolute
thermometry of the sample.

\chapter{Ultracold atoms in optical lattices}

In this chapter we consider the description of cold atoms in an optical lattice
potential.    Second quantization is introduced, and the many-body Hubbard
hamiltonian is derived, thus making the case for ultracold atoms as a nearly
ideal realization of the Hubbard model.  
% along the way we give a brief reminder of the treatment of interactions in
% cold atom gases.   
We discuss the requirements necessary for the ultracold atom system to be well
described by a single band Hubbard model.  


\section{One-dimensional optical lattice potential}

The contents of this section follow the derivation found in \S\,IV.A of the
review article by Morsch and Oberthaler.  \cite{RevModPhys.78.179}.  The
hamiltonian for an atom moving in a one-dimensional (1D) sinusoidal potential,
such as that produced by an optical lattice, is 
\begin{equation}
  H_{\text{single,1D}} = 
  - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}} 
  + \vo\sin^{2}(kx) 
 \label{eq:Hsingle1D}
\end{equation}
where $k=2\pi/\lambda$, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the lattice laser, and
$a=\lambda/2$ is the lattice spacing.  The lattice depth \vo\ is naturally
expressed in units of the recoil energy of an atom when it scatters a lattice
photon: $\er=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}$.  Defining $\vvo=\vo/\er$ the
hamiltonian reduces to  
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  H_{\text{single,1D}}= &
    -\frac{1}{k^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}} 
    + \vvo\sin^{2}(kx) \\
           = &
    -\frac{1}{k^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}} 
    + \frac{\vvo}{4}(2 - e^{2ikx} - e^{-2ikx} )  \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The solutions to the time independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for this
hamiltonian are Bloch states, which are labeled by their quasimomentum $q$ and
their band index $n$ and can be written in general form as 
\begin{equation}
  \psi_{q}^{n}(x) = e^{iqx} \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}} c_{ql}^{n} e^{ilGx}
  \label{eq:blochstate}
\end{equation}
The lattice translation invariant function that accompanies $e^{iqx}$ in a
Bloch state has been written here, with no loss of generality, as a sum of
plane waves with momenta $lG$,  where $l$ is an integer and $G=2\pi/a=2k$ is
the magnitude of the primitive vector of the reciprocal lattice. 

Acting with the hamiltonian on the Bloch states and then rearranging some of
the terms in the infinite sum, we get \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  H_{\text{single,1D}} \psi_{q}(x) = &  
      \sum_{l} \left[(q/k+2l)^{2} 
      + \frac{\vvo}{4}(2-e^{2ikx}-e^{-2ikx}) \right]
      c_{ql}^{n} e^{iqx+il2kx} \\ 
                                  = &  
      \sum_{l} \left[ \left(  (q/k+2l)^{2} 
      + \frac{\vvo}{2} \right) c_{ql}^{n} 
      - \frac{\vvo}{4}c_{q,l-1}^{n} - \frac{\vvo}{4}c_{q,l+1}^{n} \right] 
      e^{iqx+il2kx} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The quasimomentum is restriced to the first Brillouin zone, which can be taken
to be $[-\frac{\pi}{a}, \frac{\pi}{a})$.  The natural unit for the
quasimomentum is $2k$.  Defining $q'=q/(2k)$,  we can then write the
time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation as 
\begin{equation}
  \left(  (2q'+2l)^{2} + \frac{\vo}{2} \right) c_{ql}^{n}
  - \frac{\vo}{4}c_{q,l-1}^{n} - \frac{\vo}{4}c_{q,l+1}^{n} = E_{q} c_{ql}^{n} 
\end{equation}
We then have an infinite linear system of equations which determines the
$c_{qm}^{n}$. For our practical purposes we truncate the set of equations such
that $|l|<\mathcal{N}$.  The resulting equations can be written in matrix form,
for example if we select $\mathcal{N}=2$ 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{smallmatrix}\frac{1}{2} V_{{0}} + 4 \left(q -2\right)^{2} & -
\frac{1}{4} V_{{0}} & 0 & 0 & 0\\- \frac{1}{4} V_{{0}} & \frac{1}{2} V_{{0}} +
4 \left(q -1\right)^{2} & - \frac{1}{4} V_{{0}} & 0 & 0\\0 & - \frac{1}{4}
V_{{0}} & \frac{1}{2} V_{{0}} + 4 q^{2} & - \frac{1}{4} V_{{0}} & 0\\0 & 0 & -
\frac{1}{4} V_{{0}} & \frac{1}{2} V_{{0}} + 4 \left(q + 1\right)^{2} & -
\frac{1}{4} V_{{0}}\\0 & 0 & 0 & - \frac{1}{4} V_{{0}} & \frac{1}{2} V_{{0}} +
4 \left(q + 2\right)^{2}\end{smallmatrix}\right] 
%
\cdot
\left[\begin{smallmatrix} 
  c_{q,-2}^{n} \\ 
  c_{q,-1}^{n} \\ 
  c_{q,0}^{n} \\ 
  c_{q,1}^{n} \\ 
  c_{q,2}^{n} \\ 
 \end{smallmatrix}\right]
 = E_{q}^{n} 
\left[\begin{smallmatrix} 
  c_{q,-2}^{n} \\ 
  c_{q,-1}^{n} \\ 
  c_{q,0}^{n} \\ 
  c_{q,1}^{n} \\ 
  c_{q,2}^{n} \\ 
 \end{smallmatrix}\right]
\label{eq:h1dmatrix} 
\end{equation}
These equations can be solved to obtain the eigenvectors $c_{ql}^{n}$ and the
eigenvalues $E_{q}^{n}$.  In the numerical solution that we implemented  we
truncated the infinite set at $\mathcal{N}=5$.  To accurately obtain the
dispersion relationship for the $n^{\text{th}}$ band you need $\mathcal{N}\geq
n+1$.  

\subsection{Band structure}

The eigenvalues  obtained from the solutions to Eq.~\ref{eq:h1dmatrix}
correspond to the energies $E_{q}^{n}$ as a function of quasimomentum $q$ and
band index $n$ and is referred to as the band structure.  We show it for a 1D
lattice as a function of $q$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:bands1d}, and also as a function
of lattice depth in Fig.~\ref{fig:bands1d_V0} 
\begin{figure}
\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/BandStructure_figures/bands1d.pdf}
\caption[Band structure in 1D lattice.]{\small Band structure in a 1D optical
lattice.  The depth of the lattice is indicated by the shaded area, and the
energy of the hamonic oscillator ground state in a single lattice site is shown
as a dotted line.  } \label{fig:bands1d}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../figures/BandStructure_figures/bands1d_V0.pdf}
\caption[Band structure in 1D lattice.]{\small Band structure in a 1D optical
lattice.  Each band is indicated by the colored area,  the harmonic oscillator
states in an isolated lattice site are shown as black lines. }
\label{fig:bands1d_V0}
\end{figure}

The time independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the hamiltonian in
Eq.~\ref{eq:Hsingle1D}, can also be solved using Mathieu functions.  One can
also calculate the band structure by using the known properties of the Mathieu
functions, which are avaiable on tables or as functions in some software
packages (e.g. Mathematica), see for instance the treatement
in~\cite{PhysRev.87.807}. 

\subsection{Eigenstates}
For each energy eigenvalue we have an associated eigenstate  which is defined
in terms of the $c_{ql}^{n}$ by Eq.~\ref{eq:blochstate}.   Typically, numerical
diagonalization routines return the normalized eigenvectors of the matrix in
question,  and for us this means that the coefficients $c_{ql}^{n}$ will
satisfy
\begin{equation}
   \sum_{l} | c_{ql}^{n} |^{2} = 1 
\end{equation} 
This has the implication that the states obtained from Eq.~\ref{eq:blochstate}
will be normalized over a lattice site.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:eigenfuns1d}. we show
the probability density for a lowest band eigenstate as a function of position
in the lattice for various lattice depths.  One can see how, as the lattice
gets deeper, the state becomes more localized around the center of each lattice
site.

probability density over one lattice site is equal to one.  The gray shaded
region is shown to indicate the variation of the lattice potential. }
\label{fig:eigenfuns1d}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Wannier states} 
\label{sec:1Dlattice}

It is useful to define a basis of states that are localized around a single
lattice site.  We will see later on that when using such a basis the
hamiltonian for the Hubbard model takes its most familiar form.  In a finite
sized lattice with $L$ sites,  the localized state centered around the
$j^{\text{th}}$ site(at $x_{j}$) can be constructed as the following
superposition of eigenstates of the hamiltonian\footnote{In some treatments
(for instance~\cite{salomon2013many}) the Wannier function is defined with a
normalization factor of $\sqrt{L}$  rather than $L$ as shown here.   This is
considering eigenfunctions $\psi_{q}^{n}(x)$ which are normalized when
integrating over the full extent in the lattice.  We stick to the $L$
normalization factor, without the square root, since the eigenfunctions that
are obtained numerically come out normalized over a lattice site, as was
explained in the previous section.}: 
\begin{equation} w^{n}(x-x_{j}) =  \frac{1}{L} \sum_{q}  e^{-i q 2\pi x_{j} }
\psi_{q}^{n}(x) \label{eq:wannier} \end{equation} Here the sum runs over the
set of quasimomenta  $q \in \left\lbrace \frac{2\pi u}{a L} \ |\  u \in \lbrace
0,1,\ldots L-1 \rbrace \right\rbrace$.  Inserting the expnansion of
$\psi_{q}^{n}(x)$ in plane waves into the definition of the Wannier state we
obtain 
\begin{equation}
 w^{n}(x-x_{j}) \equiv w_{j}^{n}(x)= 
    \frac{1}{L} \sum_{q}  
   \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}} 
   c_{ql}^{n} 
   e^{-i 2\pi q x_{j} }  
   e^{i 2\pi(q+l)x} 
\end{equation}
We will set $x_{j}=0$ for the calculation of the Wannier function,   Wannier
states centered at different lattice sites can be obtained by translation of
the $x_{j}=0$ solution. 
\begin{equation}
  w_{0}^{n}(x)= 
    \frac{1}{L} \sum_{q}  
   \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}} 
   c_{ql}^{n} 
   e^{i 2\pi(q+l)x} 
\end{equation}
Since the hamiltonian communtes with the parity operator it is required that
$\psi_{q}^{n}(-x) = \pm \psi_{q}^{n}(x)$ which implies that $c_{ql}^{n} = \pm
c_{pl'}^{n}$ if  $(q+l) = -(p+l')$.  Using this symmettry, the Wannier state
can be written as 
\begin{equation}
  w_{0}^{n}(x)= 
    \frac{1}{L} \left(
   c_{00}^{n} + 
    \sum_{q>0} 
   \sum_{l > 0 } 
   c_{ql}^{n} \left[ e^{i 2\pi(q+l)x} \pm e^{-i 2\pi(q+l)x } \right] \right)
\end{equation}
It is shown in~\cite{Kohn1959} that the maximally localized Wannier states are
obtained if the plus sign is chosen for even bands and the minus sing is chosen
for odd bands.  So, the $x_{j}=0$ Wannier state is symmetric for the even bands
and antisymmetric for the odd bands.  
\begin{equation}
  w_{0}^{n}(x)= 
    \frac{c_{00}^{n}}{L}
   + 
    \frac{2}{L}
    \sum_{q>0} 
   \sum_{l > 0 } 
   c_{ql}^{n} 
\begin{cases}
\cos[ 2\pi(q+l)x ] & \text{if $n$ even} \\
\sin[ 2\pi(q+l)x ] & \text{if $n$ odd }
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%For $q,l>0$ all the coefficients $c_{ql}^{n}$ will have the same sign, so we
%select them to be positive.  

After defining the way to construct the Wannier states starting from the
$c_{ql}^{n}$, we can now proceed to add up the plane waves to  obtain the
states, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:wannier1d_V0} for various lattice depths.  As
the lattice depth is increased, the Wannier states become more localized, which
leads to less overlap betweeen Wannier states in adjacent sites and results in
a reduction of the probability amplitude for a particle to tunnel from one site
to the neighboring one.   More localized states also imply that the on-site
interaction will be larger, since, on average, two particles in the same site
will be closer to each other.

We also show, in Fig.~\ref{fig:wannier1d_bands}, the Wannier functions for the
first three bands in a 4$E_{R}$ lattice.

\end{figure}

\section{Three-dimensional optical lattice potential}

The hamiltonian for an atom moving in a  3D lattice can be separated in the
three spatial coordinates.  So we can use the solutions that were obtained in
the previous section for the 1D lattice and obtain the band structure and the
Wannier states for the 3D lattice.   The 3D band structure is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:bands3d_V0}. 
\begin{figure}
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../figures/BandStructure_figures/bands3d_V0.pdf}
\caption[Band structure in 3D lattice.]{\small Band structure in a 3D optical
lattice.  Each band is indicated by the colored area,  the harmonic oscillator
states in an isolated lattice site are shown as black lines. }
\label{fig:bands3d_V0}
\end{figure}

The Wannier states in a 3D lattice are simply products of the Wannier states in
each of the three spatial coordinates.  They are defined as 
\begin{equation}
 w^{n}(\bv{r}-\bv{r}_{j}) =  \frac{1}{L^{3}} \sum_{\bv{q}} e^{-i \bv{q}\cdot\bv{r}_{j} }
     \prod_{u=x,y,z}  \psi_{q_{u}}^{n_{u}}(u) 
 \label{eq:wannier3D}
\end{equation}
where $L^{3}$ is the total number of sites in the lattice. 

\section{Hubbard hamiltonian}

The many-body Hubbard hamiltonian is 
\begin{equation}
  H =  
-t \sum_{ \langle ij \rangle, \sigma   } 
          a_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{j\sigma} \\
         + U\sum_{i} n_{i\spup} n_{i\spdn}  
\end{equation}
where $i,j$ are indices that run over lattice sites, $\langle ij \rangle$
denotes nearest-neighbors, and $\sigma$ denotes the spin state of the
particles.  The particle creation and annihilation operators,  $a_{j\sigma}$
and $a_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}$,  along with the number operator $n_{i\sigma}$
arise naturally in the second quantization formalism. In what follows we will
see how to obtain this many-body form, starting from the first quantized
version of the hamiltonian for a system of $N$ particles moving in a periodic
lattice. 


The hamiltonian for a single atom in a 3D optical lattice is given by  
\begin{equation}
  H_{\text{single,3D}} = - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}
                            + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}
                            + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z^{2}} \right)
 + \vo\left( \cos^{2}(kx)  + \cos^{2}(ky) + \cos^{2}(kz) \right)
\end{equation}
and when $N$ particles are considered, along with their interactions the
hamiltonian takes a more complicated form \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  H = & \sum_{l}^{N}\left[ 
  -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{l}^{2}}
                            + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y_{l}^{2}}
                            + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z_{l}^{2}} \right)
 + \vo\left( 
        \cos^{2}(kx_{l})  + \cos^{2}(ky_{l}) + \cos^{2}(kz_{l}) 
      \right) \right]\\
      &  + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ l,n, l\neq n}^{N} 
              V_{\mathrm{int}}(\bv{r}_{l},\bv{r}_{n} )\\ 
    = & H_{0} + H_{\text{int}}
 \label{eq:hubbard1st}
\end{split} 
\end{equation} 
where the particles are labeled by indices $l$,$n$ and $V_{\mathrm{int}}$ is
the potential energy of interaction between two particles.  In the last line we
have defined the more concise notation that splits the Hamiltonian into the
non-interacting ($H_{0}$) and interacting ($H_{\text{int}}$) parts. Solving
this problem is a daunting task primarily for two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Bose or Fermi statistics of the identical particles under
consideration require the solutions to be symmetrized or antysymmetrized
products of single-particle wavefunctions.     
    \item The interactions between the particles prevent a straightforward
reformulation of the problem as a collection of easier-to-solve single particle
hamiltonians.  
\end{enumerate}

The formalism of many-body theory encapsulates a series of methods to deal with
the two issues mentioned above.   First, the reformulation of the Schrodinger
equation in the language of second quantization provides the advantage that the
statistics are automatically taken into account by the notation, so one can
essentially forget about the the (anti)symmetrization of the many-particle wave
functions.  The small price to pay is that one needs to be very careful and
consistent about the order in which operators show up in the notation, since
the symmetry properties of the resulting states are contained in the
commutation relations defined between the operators.  Furthermore, second
quantization makes it easy to consider the extended Hilbert space where the
number of particles is not fixed, known as the Fock space. 

For weak interactions, many-body theory provides a solution to the problem in
terms of perturbation expansions for the physical quantities of interest.   The
theoretical formalism also reduces most of the important physical quantities in
terms of certain matrix elements (Green's functions) which allows the user to
concentrate on obtaining such matrix elements which serve as a starting point
for the exploration of the properties of any system.   The complication arises
when the interactions are not weak, and the perturbative approach of the
many-body formalism breaks down.   


\subsection{Second quantization}

The contents of this section comprise a short summary of the treatment in the
books by Fetter and Walecka~\cite{fetter2003quantum} and
Schwabl~\cite{schwabl2005advanced}.  

Let's start with a complete orthonormal set of single particle states $\lbrace
|i\rangle \rbrace \equiv \lbrace |1\rangle, |2\rangle, \ldots \rbrace$, using these
states we can write the basis states for the $N$-particle system as
\begin{equation}
   | i_{1}, \ldots i_{\alpha}, \ldots i_{N} \rangle \equiv 
   | i_{1}\rangle_{1} \ldots |i_{\alpha}\rangle_{\alpha} \ldots 
   | i_{N} \rangle_{N} 
\end{equation} 
which represents a state in which particle 1 is in state $i_{1} \in \lbrace
|i\rangle \rbrace$, particle $\alpha$ is in state $i_{\alpha}$ and so on.
These product states are not eigenstates of the permutation operator $P_{ij}$
which interchanges particles $i$ and $j$.  However, starting from the product
states we can obtain the completely (anti)symmetrized basis states for bosons
(fermions). 

For bosons, the normalized completely symmeteric states are
\begin{equation} 
  | n_{1},  n_{2}, \ldots \rangle = 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!n_{1}!n_{2}!\ldots}} \sum_{P}  
    P | i_{1},  i_{2}, \ldots i_{N} \rangle
\end{equation} 
where the $P$'s are elements of the permutation group\footnote{For $N$
particles there are $N!$ possible permutations and thus $N!$ elements in the
permutation group.}  In this expression, $n_{i}$ is the number of times that
the state $|i\rangle$ occurs among the $N$ particles, also called the
occupation number of state $|i\rangle$.  The sum of all occupation numbers
$n_{i}$ must equal the total number of particles, but otherwise there is no
restriction in the occupation number for bosons.

For fermions the normalized completely antysymmetric states are written in the
form of Slater determinants: \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  | n_{1},  n_{2}, \ldots \rangle = &
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{P} (- 1)^{P} P | i_{1},  i_{2}, \ldots i_{N} \rangle \\
  = &
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
  \begin{vmatrix}
  |i_{1}\rangle_{1} & |i_{1}\rangle_{2} & \dotsm & |i_{1}\rangle_{N} \\
  \vdots &  \vdots &  \ddots   & \vdots \\
  |i_{N}\rangle_{1} & |i_{N}\rangle_{2} & \dotsm & |i_{N}\rangle_{N} \\
\end{vmatrix}
\end{split} 
  \label{eq:antisymmetrize} 
\end{equation}  
In this case, the product states are multiplied by a factor $(-1)^{P}$, which
is -1 for odd permutations, and +1 for even permutations.  If a single particle
state appears more than once in the product state, the resulting totally
antisymmetric state is zero,  i.e. the occupation numbers $n_{i}$ can only take
the values 0 or 1, a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle. 

For bosons (fermions), we can combine the (anti)symmeteric states for
$N=0,1,2,\ldots$ particles to obtain a complete orthonormal set of states for
arbitrary particle number.  This ``number states'' are the basis of the Fock
space. 


%We now define the creation  operators for bosons, which allow us to take a
%state from the subspace of $N$ particles, to the subspace of $N+1$  particles.
%\begin{equation}
% a_{i}^{\dagger} | \ldots, n_{i}, \ldots \rangle  = 
% \sqrt{n_{i}+1}|\ldots, n_{i}+1, \dots\rangle
%\end{equation}
%It follows that the adjoint of the creation operator is the annihilation
%operator and satisfies 
%\begin{equation}
%a_{i} | \ldots, n_{i}, \ldots \rangle  
%=\begin{cases}
%\sqrt{n_{i}}|\ldots, n_{i}-1, \dots\rangle
%& \text{if $n_{i}\geq 0$},\\
%0 & \text{if $n_{i}=0$}
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}
%The creation and annihilation operators are defined such that one can create
%any state starting from the vacuum state $|0\rangle \equiv |0,0,\ldots\rangle$
%in which there are no particles at all.  In more formal terms 
%\begin{equation}
%  | n_{1}, n_{2}, \dots \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n_{1}!n_{2}!\ldots}} 
%   ( a_{1}^{\dagger} ) ^{n_{1}}  
%   ( a_{2}^{\dagger} ) ^{n_{2}}  \ldots | 0 \rangle
%  \label{eq:numberstate}
%\end{equation}
%The boson creation and annihilation operators satisfty the Bose communtation
%relations 
%\begin{equation}
%  [a_{i}, a_{j}] = 0 \ \ \ \ \  
%  [a_{i}^{\dagger}, a_{j}^{\dagger}] = 0 \ \ \ \ \   
%  [a_{i},a_{j}^{\dagger}]=\delta_{ij}
%\end{equation}

We will concentrate in the case of fermions, and define the creation operators
such that the number state can be written as 
\begin{equation}
 | n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots \rangle = 
    \left( a_{1}^{\dagger}\right)^{n_{1}} 
    \left( a_{2}^{\dagger}\right)^{n_{2}} \ldots |0\rangle 
    ~~~~~~ n_{i} = 0\ \text{or}\ 1  
\label{eq:defnumberstate0}
\end{equation}
where $|0\rangle$ is the vacuum state in which there are no particles.  By
definition the number state is completely antisymmetric, but what does this
imply for the creation operators?  Going back to Eq.~\ref{eq:antisymmetrize},
the definition of the number states,  we see that the sign of the state depends
on the particular ordering of the states.   Suppose $n_{1}=n_{2}=0$, changing
the labels on states 1 and 2 corresponds to exchanging two rows in the Slater
determinant and thus a minus sign comes out: 
\begin{equation} 
    \left( a_{2}^{\dagger}\right)^{n_{2}} 
    \left( a_{1}^{\dagger}\right)^{n_{1}} \ldots |0\rangle  = 
  - | n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots \rangle 
    ~~~~~~ n_{i} = 0\ \text{or}\ 1  
\end{equation}
Comparing with Eq.~\ref{eq:defnumberstate0} we notice that the creation
operators must then satisfy the following anticommutation relation
\begin{equation} 
    a_{1}^{\dagger} a_{2}^{\dagger} + a_{2}^{\dagger} a_{1}^{\dagger} 
   \equiv  \left\lbrace  a_{1}^{\dagger} , a_{2}^{\dagger} \right\rbrace 
   = 0 
\end{equation}
Notice that this anticommutation relation implies $\left( a_{i}^{\dagger}
\right)^{2} = 0$, which is yet another manifestation of the Pauli exclusion
principle.
   
When dealing with Fermions, one must decide first on a particular ordering of
the single particle states and then stick to it, noticing that to produce the
number states (without a minus sign) all the creation operators must be applied
in the chosen order.   The action of a creation operator on a number state is
obtained using the anticommutator and the sign prescription as
\begin{equation}  
  a_{i}^{\dagger}| \ldots, n_{i}, \ldots \rangle 
  =    (-1)^{\sum_{k<i} n_{k}} | \ldots, n_{i}+1, \ldots \rangle 
 \label{eq:defcreation}
\end{equation} 
The factor $(-1)^{\sum_{k<i} n_{k}}$ takes care of the number of
anticommutations needed to place the $a_{i}^{\dagger}$ operator to the right
position.  The action of the fermion annihilation operators can be inferred by
taking the adjoint of Eq.~ \ref{eq:defcreation}.  One can then obtain all of
the anticommutation rules for fermions: 
\begin{equation}
  \left\lbrace a_{i}, a_{j} \right\rbrace = 0 \ \ \ \ \  
  \left\lbrace a_{i}^{\dagger}, a_{j}^{\dagger} \right\rbrace = 0 \ \ \ \ \   
  \left\lbrace a_{i},a_{j}^{\dagger} \right\rbrace=\delta_{ij}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Operators in second quantization}

So far two great leaps have been taken: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item We have swept antisymmetrization under the rug by introducing the number
states, defined from the vacuum in terms of creation operators wich satisfy the
Fermi anticommutation rules.  
 \item We started from an $N$ particle hamiltonian, but we have now defined
states that can handle the description of systems with an arbitrary number of
particles 
\end{enumerate}
The two ideas mentioned are related to the states used to describe the system,
now we will turn to the problem of the observables and see how they are handled
in the second quantization.  


Let us consider the sum $\sum_{\alpha} |i\rangle_{\alpha} \langle j | _{\alpha}
$ where $|i\rangle$ and $|j\rangle$ are single particle states, and $\alpha$
runs over all particles in the system.  We apply the sum to the number states
as defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:antisymmetrize}: 
\begin{equation}
  \left(
   \sum_{\alpha} |i\rangle_{\alpha} \langle j | _{\alpha}  \right)
  | n_{1},  n_{2}, \ldots \rangle = 
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{P} (- 1)^{P} P 
  \left( \sum_{\alpha} |i\rangle_{\alpha} \langle j | _{\alpha} 
   | i_{1},  i_{2}, \ldots i_{N} \rangle \right)
\end{equation}
For the term in the right not to vanish, the initial number state  must have a
particle in state $|j\rangle$, i.e. it must have $n_{j}=1$. Also $n_{i}=0$,  or
else the completely antisymmteric state will vanish.  If the particle initially
in state $|j\rangle$ is labeled as  $J$  we can write
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \left(
   \sum_{\alpha} |i\rangle_{\alpha} \langle j | _{\alpha}  \right)
  | n_{1},  n_{2}, \ldots \rangle = &
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{P} (- 1)^{P} P \left( 
    |i_{1}\rangle_{1}
    |i_{2}\rangle_{2}
    \ldots 
     \!\!\!\!\!\!
    \underbrace{ 
    |i\rangle_{J} }_{\text{instead of } |j\rangle_{J}} 
     \!\!\!\!\!\!
    \ldots 
    |i_{N}\rangle_{N}
  \right) \\
   =&  
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
  \begin{vmatrix}
  |i_{1}\rangle_{1} & |i_{1}\rangle_{2} & \dotsm & |i_{1}\rangle_{N} \\
  \vdots &  \vdots &     & \vdots \\
  |i\rangle_{1} & |i\rangle_{2} & \dotsm & |i\rangle_{N} \\
  \vdots &  \vdots &     & \vdots \\
  |i_{N}\rangle_{1} & |i_{N}\rangle_{2} & \dotsm & |i_{N}\rangle_{N} \\
\end{vmatrix} \\
\end{split} 
\end{equation}
In the determinant of the left, the state $|i\rangle$ appears in the
$j^{\text{th}}$ row, so a few rows need to be exchanged to put it in the
correct place according to our sign convention for the number states:
\begin{multline}
  \left(
   \sum_{\alpha} |i\rangle_{\alpha} \langle j | _{\alpha}  \right)
  | n_{1},  n_{2}, \ldots \rangle = \\  
 \begin{cases}
(-1)^{\sum_{k<j} n_{k} + \sum_{k<i}n_{k}~~~}
   \,| n_{1}, n_{2},  \ldots, n_{i}+1, \ldots,  n_{j}-1, \ldots  \rangle   
& \text{if $i\leq j$},\\
(-1)^{\sum_{k<j} n_{k} + \sum_{k<i}n_{k} -1 } 
   \,| n_{1}, n_{2},  \ldots, n_{j}-1, \ldots,  n_{i}+1, \ldots  \rangle
& \text{if $i>j$}
\end{cases}  
\end{multline}
Checking the definition of the creation and annihilation operators we obtain
the important result 
\begin{equation}
  \left(
   \sum_{\alpha} |i\rangle_{\alpha} \langle j | _{\alpha}  \right)
  | n_{1},  n_{2}, \ldots \rangle 
   =   a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j} 
  | n_{1},  n_{2}, \ldots \rangle 
  ~~~~~ \Rightarrow ~~~~~ 
   \sum_{\alpha} |i\rangle_{\alpha} \langle j | _{\alpha} = 
     a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j} 
\end{equation}

We now turn our attention to the operators in the $N$-particle system.
Consider an operator $T$ that is a sum over single particle operators
\begin{equation}
  T = \sum_{\alpha} t_{\alpha}
 \label{eq:defsingleparticleop}
\end{equation}  
If we insert the completness relation for the single particle states twice in
this sum we have \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  T = & \sum_{\alpha} \left( \sum_{i} |i\rangle_{\alpha}\langle i |_{\alpha} \right)
        t_{\alpha} \left( \sum_{j} |j\rangle_{\alpha}\langle j |_{\alpha} \right) \\
    = & \sum_{ij}   \langle i | t | j \rangle  \sum_{\alpha} |i\rangle_{\alpha} \langle j |_{\alpha} \\ 
    = & \sum_{ij}   \langle i | t | j \rangle a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j} \equiv \sum_{ij} t_{ij}   a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j} 
\end{split}  
\end{equation}
This is the other big leap provided by the second quantization:  an operator
that was written as a sum over particles becomes a sum of creation and
annihilation operators over single particle states.   We will apply this
prescription to the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian for $N$ particles
moving in a lattice.  

Operators like the potential energy, which are a sum over two-particle (or
many-particle) operators,  can be similarly expressed as sums of creation and
annihilation operators.  For a two-body operator we have the expression
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
F = & \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha\neq\beta} f(\bv{r}_{\alpha}, \bv{r}_{\beta} )  \\
  = & \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijkm} \langle ij | f | km \rangle 
        a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j}^{\dagger} a_{m} a_{k} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Second quantized Hubbard hamiltonian}

The Hubbard hamiltonian in Eq.~\ref{eq:hubbard1st} is a sum of two
single-particle operators and one two-particle operator.  These are,
respectively: the kinetic energy, the energy of the atoms in the lattice
potential, and the interactions between the atoms.  In this section we will
express the Hubbard hamiltonian in second quantized form.  As a single-particle
basis we will use the Wannier states that were derived in
Section.~\ref{sec:1Dlattice}

%In the Hubbard hamiltonian the two single-particle operators are grouped
%together to define the non-interacting part of the hamiltonian 
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%  H_{0} = & \sum_{l}^{N} -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{l}^{2}}
%                            + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y_{l}^{2}}
%                            + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z_{l}^{2}} \right)
% + \vo\left( \cos^{2}(kx_{l})  + \cos^{2}(ky_{l}) + \cos^{2}(kz_{l}) \right) \\
%       = & \sum_{l}^{N} H_{\text{single,3D}}^{l}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

\paragraph{Tunneling matrix element, $t$} $H_{0}$ is a single particle operator
of the kind defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:defsingleparticleop}
\begin{equation}
  H_{0} = 
     \sum_{l=1}^{N} H_{\text{single,3D}}^{l}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
H_{\text{single,3D}}^{l} = 
  -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \left( \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{l}^{2}}
                            + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y_{l}^{2}}
                            + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z_{l}^{2}} \right)
 + \vo\left( \cos^{2}(kx_{l})  + \cos^{2}(ky_{l}) + \cos^{2}(kz_{l}) \right) 
\end{equation}
It's second quantized form it can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  H_{0} = & \sum_{ij} \langle i| H_{\text{single,3D}} |j \rangle a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j} \\
        = & -\sum_{ij} t_{ij}  a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}  
Note that the sign of $t_{ij}$ was picked rather arbitrarily to follow the
usual conventions.  We now proceed to find the value of the matrix element.
We use the definition of the Wannier states given in Eq.~\ref{eq:wannier3D} to
find 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
-t_{ij}  
= & 
  \frac{1}{L^{6}}\int \mathrm{d}\bv{r}\ 
     \sum_{\bv{q}'} e^{i \bv{q'}\cdot\bv{r}_{i} }
     \prod_{u'=x,y,z}  \psi_{q'_{u'}}^{n'_{u'}*}(u') 
  \Big( H_{\text{single,3D}}  \Big)
     \sum_{\bv{q}} e^{-i \bv{q}\cdot\bv{r}_{j} }
     \prod_{u=x,y,z}  \psi_{q_{u}}^{n_{u}}(u)\\ 
= &
  \sum_{\bv{q}\bv{q}'}   
  \frac{E_{\bv{q}}^{n}}{L^{6}}
   e^{ i \bv{q}'\cdot\bv{r}_{i} }  e^{ -i \bv{q}\cdot\bv{r}_{j} }
   \int\mathrm{d}\bv{r}\ 
     \prod_{u'=x,y,z}  \psi_{q'_{u'}}^{n'_{u'}*}(u') 
     \prod_{u=x,y,z}  \psi_{q_{u}}^{n_{u}}(u) \\ 
= &
  \sum_{\bv{q}\bv{q}'}   
  \frac{E_{\bv{q}}^{n}}{L^{6}}
   e^{ i \bv{q}'\cdot\bv{r}_{i} }  e^{ -i \bv{q}\cdot\bv{r}_{j} }
   \delta_{\bv{q}\bv{q}'} \delta_{nn'} L^{3} \\
= &
  \frac{1}{L^{3}}
  \sum_{\bv{q}}   E_{\bv{q}}^{n}
   e^{ i \bv{q}\cdot(\bv{r}_{i} - \bv{r}_{j}) } \\
\end{split} 
\end{equation}
We observe that there is no amplitude to go between states that are in two
different bands, as is indicated by the appereance of $\delta_{nn'}$.   In what
follows we will consider only the lowesrt band, $n=0$,  so we will drop the
band index altogether.  This simplification imposes two important requirements
for our system:
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The temperature and the Fermi energy need to be small compared to
the energy gap between the lowest and first excited band.}

\item \textbf{The interaction energy scale must also be small compared to the
energy gap between the lowest and first excited band.}
\end{enumerate}

In the 3D lattice, the total energy is the sum of the energy associated with
each quasimomentum component, $E_{\bv{q}} = \sum_{u=x,y,z} E_{q_{u}} $, and
by inserting this into the sum for $t_{ij}$ above we find 
\begin{multline}
-t_{ij} =  \frac{1}{L^{3}} \left[ 
          \left(\sum_{q_{x}} E_{q_{x}}   e^{ i q_{x} x_{ij} }   \right)
          \sum_{q_{y}} e^{ i q_{y} y_{ij} }   
          \sum_{q_{z}} e^{ i q_{z} z_{ij} }  
   \right. \\
\left. 
          + 
          \sum_{q_{x}} e^{ i q_{x} x_{ij} }  
          \left(\sum_{q_{y}} E_{q_{y}}   e^{ i q_{y} x_{ij} }   \right)
          \sum_{q_{z}} e^{ i q_{z} z_{ij} }  
          + 
          \sum_{q_{x}} e^{ i q_{x} x_{ij} }  
          \sum_{q_{y}} e^{ i q_{y} y_{ij} }   
          \left(\sum_{q_{z}} E_{q_{z}}   e^{ i q_{z} z_{ij} }   \right)
\right]
\end{multline}
We make use of the identity $\sum_{q_{u}} e^{ iq_{u}(u_{i}-u_{j}) } = L \delta_{u_{i}u_{j}}$ to obtain
\begin{equation}
-t_{ij} =  \frac{1}{L} \left[ 
          \left(\sum_{q_{x}} E_{q_{x}}^{\text{\tiny 1D}}   e^{ i q_{x} x_{ij} }   \right)
          \delta_{y_{i}y_{j}}
          \delta_{z_{i}z_{j}}
          + 
          \left(\sum_{q_{y}} E_{q_{y}}^{\text{\tiny 1D}}   e^{ i q_{y} x_{ij} }   \right)
          \delta_{x_{i}x_{j}}
          \delta_{z_{i}z_{j}}
          + 
          \left(\sum_{q_{z}} E_{q_{z}}^{\text{\tiny 1D}}   e^{ i q_{z} z_{ij} }   \right)
          \delta_{x_{i}x_{j}}
          \delta_{y_{i}y_{j}}
\right]
\label{eq:tunnelinglong}
\end{equation}

If $i=j$ we have 
\begin{equation}
  -t_{ii} =  \frac{3}{L} 
          \sum_{q} E_{q} 
\end{equation}
Since $q$ runs over the $L$ different values in the set $q \in \left\lbrace
\frac{2\pi u}{a L} \ |\  u \in \lbrace 0,1,\ldots L-1 \rbrace \right\rbrace$,
$-t_{ii}$ is nothing more than the mean energy of the 3D energy band, which we will refer to as $E_{0}$,  $-t_{ii}\equiv E_{0}$  

If $i\neq j$,  tunneling can only occur along one of the lattice directions as
can be seen from the different Kronecker delta terms that show up in
Eq.~\ref{eq:tunnelinglong}.   In other words, for the simple cubic potential,
diagonal tunneling events are second order processes.  If we write the distance
between sites $i$,$j$ as $\Delta_{ij}$, the tunneling matrix element simplifies
to  \footnote{In this section we have used the Wannier states constructed as a
sum of plane waves to obtain the tunneling matrix element.  It can also be
obtained directly from the Wannier states'  wavefunctions:
\begin{equation}
  -t_{ij} = \int \mathrm{d}\bv{r} \, w_{i}(\bv{r}) H_{\text{single,3D}} w_{j}(\bv{r}) 
\end{equation}
Calculating the tunneling matrix element by computing the overlap integral of
the Wannier wavefuctions is computationally more expensive than obtaining it as
a sum over the energy eigenvalues. }
\begin{equation}
  -t_{ij} = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{q} E_{q} e^{iq \Delta_{ij}} 
\label{eq:tunneling3D}
\end{equation}
In the tight-binding approximation terms for which $i,j$ are not nearest
neighbors are neglected, and  $\Delta_{ij}$ can only take the values $\lbrace
-a, a \rbrace$, where $a$ is the lattice spacing.  In this case we use
$t_{ij}\equiv t$, where $t$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  -t = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{q} E_{q} e^{iqa} 
\label{eq:tunneling3D_tight}
\end{equation}

We can then go ahead and write the second quantized form of $H_{0}$ in the
tight-binding approximation 
\begin{equation} 
  H_{0}  =  E_{0} \sum_{i}  a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{i}  - t 
    \sum_{ \langle i j \rangle }
                      a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j}   
\end{equation} 
The first term in this expression is constant for a system with a conserved
number of particles, since $\sum_{i}  a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{i}=N$.    Usually this
energy offset is neglected, but when dealing with inhomogeneous systems which
have a position dependent lattice depth it will be important to take it into
account, as will be seen later on.   


We can go ahead and invert the Fourier series in Eq.~\ref{eq:tunneling3D} to
obtain 
\begin{equation} 
  E_{q} = - \sum_{\Delta_{ij}} t_{ij} e^{-iq \Delta_{ij}} 
\end{equation}
which in the tight-binding approximation reduces to 
\begin{equation}
  E_{q} = -2 t\cos( qa) 
\end{equation}
This explicit form for the dispersion relation allows us to relate the
bandwidth to the tunneling matrix element as $W_{\text{1D}}=4t$,  which in 3D
becomes $W_{\text{3D}}= 12t$.

It is useful to find out the range of lattice depths for which the
tight-binding approximation is valid in the optical lattice potential.  To do
this we just need to look at the tunneling matrix elements for beyond
nearest-neighbor tunneling,  as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tightbinding}.  For
lattice depths $\gtrsim 5 E_{R}$  we can safely ignore beyond nearest-neighbor
tunneling.  
\begin{figure}
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../figures/BandStructure_figures/tightbinding_V0_interp.pdf}
\caption[Tunneling matrix elements in a 3D lattice.]{\small Tunneling matrix

and beyond nearest neighbor matrix elements are shown to illustrate the range
of lattice depths for which the tight-binding limit is a good approximation.
$X_{ij}$ corresponds to the distance between intial and final site in the
tunneling matrix element. 
 } \label{fig:tightbinding}
\end{figure}

Yet another way of estimating the tunneling matrix element \cite{Bloch2008} is
by using the relationship $t=W_{\text{1D}}/4$, valid in the tight-binding
limit,  and obtaining the bandwidth from the known properties of the Mathieu
functions, which are solutions to the Schrodinger equation in a 1D lattice.
This yields the analytic result 
\begin{equation}
 t/\er \simeq \frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}} \vvo^{3/4} \exp(-2\sqrt{\vvo}) 
\label{eq:tunnelMathieu}
\end{equation} 
where \vvo\ is the lattice depth in units of the recoil energy. The comparison
between the result from Eq.~\ref{eq:tunneling3D} and Eq.~\ref{eq:tunnelMathieu}
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tMathieu}. 
\begin{figure}

obtained from the Mathieu functions.  The right panel shows the tunneling rate
in kHz for the mass of a $^{6}$Li atom.  } \label{fig:tMathieu}
\end{figure}

%Finally, we have the second quantized form of $H_{0}$ in the tight-binding
%limit 
%\begin{equation}
%  H_{0} = -t \sum_{ \langle ij \rangle } a_{i}^{\dagger}a_{j} 
%\end{equation}
%where the $\langle \rangle$ denote nearest-neighbors, and the creation operator
%$a_{i}^{\dagger}$ create particles in the Wannier state localized at site $i$.

Notice that up to now we have ignored the spin part of the wavefunction.   We
can include it easilly by noticing that $H_{0}$ does not act on the spin at
all, so the states $|i\rangle$ and $|j\rangle$ that we have used in the
derivation above need to have the same spin.   If two spin states are
available, our basis set is twice as large, which can be taken care of by
including a sum over spin states:
\begin{equation}
  H_{0} = E_{0}N -\ t
   \!\!\! 
  \sum_{ \langle ij \rangle, \sigma=\dbl   } 
   \!\!\!
  a_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{j\sigma} 
\end{equation}

\paragraph{On-site interaction energy, $U$}

The interaction part of the hamiltonian for $N$ particles is
given by \begin{equation}
    H_{\text{int}} = 
         \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ l,m, l\neq m}^{N} 
         V_{\mathrm{int}}(\bv{r}_{l},\bv{r}_{m} )\\ 
\end{equation}
This is a two-particle operator, and its second quantized form is given by
\begin{equation}
   H_{\text{int}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j,k,m} 
           \langle ij | V_{\mathrm{int}} | km \rangle
           a_{i}^{\dagger} a_{j}^{\dagger} a_{m} a_{k}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
    \langle ij | V_{\mathrm{int}} | km \rangle =
    \int \mathrm{d}\bv{r}_{1} \int \mathrm{d}\bv{r}_{2} \ \  
    \varphi_{i}^{*}(\bv{r}_{1}) \varphi_{j}^{*}(\bv{r}_{2}) 
    V_{\mathrm{int}}(\bv{r}_{1},\bv{r}_{2}) 
    \varphi_{k}(\bv{r}_{1}) \varphi_{m}(\bv{r}_{2}) 
\end{equation}
and here the $\varphi$ correspond to the wavefunctions of the single particle
basis states chosen. 

The interaction between ultracold atoms can be described in terms of the
$s$-wave scattering length, $a_{s}$,  and a pseudopotential given
by~\cite{Bloch2008}
\begin{equation}
    V_{\mathrm{int}}(\bv{r}_{1},\bv{r}_{2}) 
    = \frac{ 4 \pi \hbar^{2} a_{s} } { m } \delta(\bv{r}_{1}-\bv{r}_{2}) 
\end{equation}
so the matrix element above can be written as 
\begin{equation}
    \langle ij | V_{\mathrm{int}} | km \rangle =
\frac{ 4 \pi \hbar^{2} a_{s} } { m }
    \int \mathrm{d}\bv{r}  \ \  \varphi_{i}^{*}(\bv{r}) \varphi_{j}^{*}(\bv{r}) \varphi_{k}(\bv{r}) \varphi_{m}(\bv{r}) 
\end{equation}
Our basis states, $\varphi$, are the 3D Wannier states defined in
Eq.~\ref{eq:wannier3D}, which are separable in the three spatial coordinates.
We recall that the Wannier states are labeled by the lattice site around which
they are centered and by their band index.   If we explicitly write out the two
labels in the expression above, we obtain
\begin{equation}
    \langle ij | V_{\mathrm{int}} | km \rangle =
\frac{ 4 \pi \hbar^{2} a } { m }
  \prod_{v=x,y,z}
    \int \mathrm{d}v  \ \ 
    w_{i}^{n_{i}}(v) w_{j}^{n_{j}}(v) w_{k}^{n_{k}}(v) w_{m}^{n_{m}}(v)
\end{equation}

In general $i,j,k,m$ can represent any lattice sites,  however we will restrict
our treatment to onsite interactions by enforcing $i=j=k=m$.  Furthermore, we
consider only Wannier states in the lowest band, which is a good approximation
as long as the $s$-wave scattering lengths is very small compared to the
single-site harmonic oscillator length~\cite{Busch1998}. 
%The Wannier function along  $x,y,z$ depends on the lattice depth along the
%respective coordinate.  We will consider a lattice with different depths along
%the three spatial coordinates, $\bvo = ( V_{0x}, V_{0y}, V_{0z} ) $.  At this
%point we make the approximation of neglecting all of the off-site interaction
%terms, which can be justified by the localized nature of the Wannier states.
%Furthermore, we consider only Wannier states in the lowest band, which is
%valid for scattering lengths smaller than the single-site harmonic oscillator
%length~\cite{Busch1998}.  
With this considerations, and also explicitly writing down the spin quantum
number, which so far was implicit in the indices $ijkm$, we find 
\begin{equation}
   H_{\text{int}} =  
           \frac{U}{2}\sum_{\sigma\neq\sigma'}\sum_{i} 
           a_{i\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{i\sigma'}^{\dagger} a_{i\sigma'} a_{i\sigma} \\
\end{equation}
Defining the number operator as $n_{i\sigma} = a_{i\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{i\sigma}$ 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
   H_{\text{int}}  
     = & \  
           \frac{U}{2}\sum_{\sigma\neq\sigma'}\sum_{i}
           n_{i\sigma'} n_{i\sigma}  \\
     = & \ 
           U\sum_{i}
           n_{i\spup} n_{i\spdn}  
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $i$ runs over all of the lattice sites. 
%\begin{equation}
%  U = 
%  \frac{ 4 \pi \hbar^{2} a } { m }
%   \prod_{v=x,y,z}  \int  w(v) ^{4} \mathrm{d}v  
%\end{equation}
%In units of $E_{R}$, 
\begin{equation}
  U/\er = \frac{ 8}{ \pi}  \frac{ a_{s} }{a}
   \prod_{v=x,y,z}  \int  w(v) ^{4} \mathrm{d}v  
\end{equation} 

If the Wannier state is approximated by the Gaussian ground state in the local
oscillator potential of one lattice site, the integral can be carried out
analitically to obtain ~\cite{Bloch2008} 
\begin{equation} 
  U  = \sqrt{ 8\pi } \frac{a_{s}}{a} \vvo^{3/4} 
\end{equation} 

Alternatively we can use the Wannier states as obtained in
Sec.~\ref{sec:1Dlattice} and obtain a more accurate result.
Figure~\ref{fig:wfactor} shows a comparison of the two methods for a lattice
with $\lambda=1064$\,nm. 
\begin{figure}
\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/BandStructure_figures/wFactor_V0_a0.pdf}
\caption[On-site interactions in a 3D lattice]{\small On-site interactions in a
3D lattice as a function of lattice depth.  Numerical calculation using Wannier
functions compeared to the approximation using harmonic oscillator states.  The
lattice depth is the same in all three directions of the lattice.   The lattice
wavelength is 1064~nm, and it is used to express the interactions in units of
recoils divided by Bohr radius.  The right panel shows it in kHz over Bohr
radius for the mas of a $^{6}$Li atom.} \label{fig:wfactor}
\end{figure}

If the scattering length is too large, the onsite interaction term calculated
here starts being comparable to the interband spacing, and the single band
approximation is no longer valid.   

SO FAR IS DONE

One can treat the problem of two atoms
intearcting in the local harmonic oscillator around a lattice
site~\cite{Busch1998}.   Another approach consists of redefining the single
particle basis states (using linear combinations of Wannier states in different
bands) such that the interaction matrix element is diagonal in the new basis,
see for instance~\cite{Jordens2010,Mark2012}. In more formal terms one would
find states
\begin{equation}
 \varphi_{i }^{nm}  =  \sum_{st} c_{st}^{nm} w_{i}^{s}(\bv{r} ) w_{i}^{t}(\bv{r})
\end{equation}  
such that 
\begin{equation}
  \langle nm | V_{\mathrm{int}} | op \rangle =  \delta_{n,o}\delta_{m,p}
\end{equation}
The problem of finding the coefficients $c_{st}^{nm}$ can be tackled
numerically by using linear combinations of Wannier states in only
the first few bands.

\chapter{The Fermi-Hubbard model}

approximate solutions to the Hubbard model are explained,  including the
high-temperature series expansion (HTSE) which is widely used throughout this
thesis.   

%The Fermi-Hubbard model was formally presented to the world by Hubbard in his
%1950 paper titled ``whatever''.  Perhaps he could suspect at the time that he
%was then fathering a model that to this day remains at the center of condensed
%matter physics.   

In this section I present the model in its original context, as a
simplification of the description of valence electrons in crystalline solids.
I include some historical background to motivate the reader.  

Models for electrons existed which explained conduction phenomena in a
succesful manner.  Also, models existed which dealt with magnetic phenomena.
This section touches on the necessity to formulate a model that could
incorporate both transport and magnetic properties of a material.   This need
arises due to the existence of materials that are at neither end of the
spectrum.  That is, metals or insulators for which magnetic effects played an
imporant role.   The simple example being MnO, on which antiferromagnetism was
first observed,  and the big challenge being high-temperature
superconductors. 

\section{Simplified treatements}

This section explains our understanding of the Fermi-Hubbard model.  It starts
by building some insight by using the results of exactly solvable models.   The
results of exct diagonalization in systems of 2-sites and 4-sites are shown.
This are going to motivate the antiferromagnetic character of the ground state,
while showing that there is always a bit of an admixture of double occupancy in
the exact ground state.  

The 4-site solution can be used to help understand why the Fermi-Hubbard is relevant to high-Tc superconductors.   In this case one can make connections to the $d$-wave character of ground states upon doping the system.   

The exact diagonalization solutions are at zero temperature, so they give most
insight to the exact ground states of the system.

\subsection{ Limiting cases} 

This section deals with the limiting cases of the Fermi-Hubbard parameters.
The solutions that are obtained give insights to the workings of the model.
The high temperature series expansion is introduced, which is very relevant for
calculating thermodynamic quantitites in the temperature regime of a few times
$T_{\mathrm{Neel}}$.  



\subsubsection { U=0 limit, t=0 limit }



\subsection{ High-temperature series expansion  }

In the atomic limit, where tunneling between sites is neglected completely, the
Hubbard model can solved exactly.  In this case the tunneling part of the
hamiltonian can be treated as a perturbation and we can gain insight in to the
different phases that the system can exhibit.  This Section follows the
treatment that can be found in~\cite{Henderson1992,Jordens2010}.   

We work in the grand canonical ensemble, so we include a global chemical potential
in the hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  H = &  
         \left( U\sum_{i} n_{i\spup} n_{i\spdn}  
         - \mu\sum_{i}( n_{i\spup} + n_{i\spdn} ) \right)
-t \sum_{ \langle ij \rangle, \sigma   } 
          a_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{j\sigma} \\
   = &  H_{0} + H_{1} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
For the unberturbed part, $H_{0}$, the grand canonical partition function is 
\begin{equation}
 Z_{0} = \text{Tr} e^{-\beta H_{0}} 
\end{equation}
Since the unperturbed part is a sum over sites, the partition function becomes
a product of the single site partition function, $Z_{0} = z_{0}^{k}$, for a
system with $k$ sites.  The single site partition function  is easy to
calculate because the trace runs over the only four possible states in a single
site $\lbrace |0\rangle, |\spup\rangle, |\spdn\rangle, |\dbl\rangle\rbrace$.
\begin{equation}
 z_{0} = 1 + 2 e^{\beta\mu} + e^{\beta (2\mu-U)} = 1 + 2z + z^{2}u 
\end{equation}
where we have defined $z=e^{\beta\mu}$ and $u=e^{-\beta U }$.  Among the
relevant physical quantities that can be obtained are the number of particles,
the number of double occupancies, and the entropy per site.  These are obtained
from the first derivatives of the grand canonical potential, $\Omega$
\begin{equation}
  \Omega = - \frac{\ln Z}{\beta}
\end{equation}
\begin{gather}
  N = -\frac{\partial \Omega}{ \partial \mu }\\
  D = \frac{\partial \Omega}{ \partial U }  \\
  S = -\frac{\partial \Omega}{ \partial T} 
\end{gather}
%\begin{gather}
%  N = -\frac{\partial \Omega}{ \partial \mu }  = z \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \ln Z\\
%  D = \frac{\partial \Omega}{ \partial U }  = u \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \ln Z\\
%  S = -\frac{\partial \Omega}{ \partial T}  = -\beta^{2}  \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \ln Z
%\end{gather}
Also, from the second derivatives of the grand potential one can obtain the
fluctuations in any of these quantitites. 

For the full hamiltonian the grand canonical partition function $Z$ can be
expanded in a perturbation series~\cite{Henderson1992} 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  Z = & \text{Tr} e^{-\beta H}  \\
    = & Z_{0} \left[ 1 + 
        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n} 
        \int_{0}^{\beta} d\tau_{1} \int_{0}^{\tau_{1}} d\tau_{2} 
        \dotsm \int_{0}^{\tau_{n-1}} d\tau_{n} 
        \langle
              \tilde{H}_{1}(\tau_{1}) 
              \tilde{H}_{2}(\tau_{2})  \dotsm
              \tilde{H}_{n}(\tau_{n})  \rangle 
              \right] 
\end{split}
\end{equation} 
where the thermal expectation value is taken with the
unperturbed part of the hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
\langle A \rangle = \text{Tr} ( e^{\beta H_{0} } A ) / Z_{0} 
\end{equation}
and the tilde means that the operator is evaluated in the interaction picture
for the imaginary time in parenthesis: 
\begin{equation}
 \tilde{H}_{1}(\tau) = e^{\tau H_{0}} H_{1} e^{-\tau H_{0}} 
\end{equation}
Given the series expansion for $Z$, the grand potential is 
\begin{equation}
 -\beta \Omega = Z_{0} + 
        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n} 
        \int_{0}^{\beta} d\tau_{1} \int_{0}^{\tau_{1}} d\tau_{2} 
        \dotsm \int_{0}^{\tau_{n-1}} d\tau_{n} 
        \langle
              \tilde{H}_{1}(\tau_{1}) 
              \tilde{H}_{2}(\tau_{2})  \dotsm
              \tilde{H}_{n}(\tau_{n})  \rangle 
\end{equation}

One can see that the $n^{th}$ term in the expansion has $n$ copies of the
tunneling part of the hamiltonian.  Each  application of $H_{1}$ in the thermal
average results in a particle tunneling to a neighboring site, so we see that
there will be a contribution to the expansion only if after $n$ tunneling
events all the particles come back to their original sites.  A direct
consequence of this is that the first order term in the expansion vanishes.
The second order in the expansion corresponds to particles tunneling one site
over and then coming back.  Higher order terms can be represented by diagrams,
to make them easier to keep track off.  The contribution from orders up to
$n=9$ is shown in~\cite{Henderson1992}.  Here we will use up to the second
order term to illustrate the phases that appear in the system.  

The grand potential to second order is~\cite{Henderson1992,Jordens2010} 
\begin{equation}
-\beta \Omega_{2} = k \ln z_{0} + k \left( \frac{\beta t }{z_{0}} \right)^{2} m 
        \left( z + z^{3} u + 2z^{2} \frac{1-u}{\beta U} \right) 
\end{equation} 
where $m$ is the number of nearest neighbors for each lattice site, which in
the simple cubic case is $m=6$.  We see that the grand potential is
proportional to the number of lattice sites, so we will obtain all the
thermodynamic quantities per lattice site. 

The resulting phase diagram is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:highTphases}.  NOTE FOR
GROUP MEETING:  I intend to write some text that discusses the relevant phases
in this phase diagram.  I will discuss them in the presentation in the group
meeting and add the explanatory text in this document later on.

\subsubsection{Thermodynamics at colder temperatures, apparoach to the N\'{e}el transition}

In this section we show the phase diagram for the Fermi-Hubbard model at lower
temperatures, which are beyond the scope of the perturbation expansion shown in
the previous section.   The phase diagram was calculated in~\cite{Fuchs2011} by
using cluster dynamical mean-field theory, and they have made their results
available in the supplementary material accompanying their paper.  In
Figures~\ref{fig:fuchs10},\ref{fig:fuchs01},\ref{fig:fuchs03} we show the
resulting phase diagram for $T/t=$ 10, 1, and 0.3 respectively.

\subsection{ Local density approximation }



The phase diagrams calculated in the two previous sections assume a homogeneous
lattice.  In our experiment the lattice has an underlying confining potential,
which can be dealt with by considering a local chemical potential at each point
in the trap given by
\begin{equation}
 \mu(\bv{r}) = \mu - V(\bv{r}) 
\end{equation}
An homogeneous lattice phase diagram can be used to obtain the local density,
local entropy, and local double occupancy at any point in our system by using
as inputs the local chemical potential,  the local value of the tunneling
matrix element and the local value of the on-site interaction.  

The methods used to calculate the phase diagrams are related to the validity of
the local density approximation.   We recall that in the high temperature
series expansion, the $n^{\text{th}}$  term corresponds to a particle staring
at a certain site, tunneling $n$ times and then coming back to its original
site.  If $\sqrt{n}$ becomes comparable to the lenght scale of variations in
the confining potential, then the local density would not be a suitable
description of the system, because in those $n$ steps the particle can sample a
very different confining potential.  

Similarly, in the cluster dynamical mean-field theory, results are obtained for
finite sized clusters of various sizes and then extrapolated to the infinite
size limit~\cite{Fuchs2011}.  At low temperatures, the system develops
long-range correlations, so large clusters are required to approximate the
system.   If the local site energy varies considerably over the size of a
cluster then the local density approximation will break down.
