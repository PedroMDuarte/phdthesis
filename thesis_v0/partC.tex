\chapter{Miscellaneous information about the experiment}
\label{app:misc}


In this appendix we show data that may be useful for the future generations of
students running this experiment, but that did not really fit in other parts of
this thesis. 

\section{Gradient calibration for levitaion}  
\section{Pushing with green and no gradient cancellation}
\section{ODT position as a function of temperature in the lab}
\section{Calibration of magnetic field with the RF 1-2 splitting}
\section{Humidity dependence of trichroic green reflectivity}
\section{Rabi oscillations on 1-2 transition}
