Use paste commmand to join two files together, for example to join the 2S with the 2P files. 

Then remove the ^M characters left by Mathematica in vim using :%s/ctrl-vctrl-m//g  

Then use gnuplot scripts to plot and analyze the joined data. 

 
2S3Pcombined.dat, 2S2Pcombined.dat:

1st and 8th column are the field, and they are redundent.
